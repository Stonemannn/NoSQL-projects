# Redis_Chatbot

This Chatbot uses Redis's Pub/Sub mechanism to realize  real-time messaging. I created this Chatbot by integrating Redis with Python.

### Instruction
To use this Chatbot for fun, you should first run the docker-compose file in this directory to create 2 containers: one is for python and the other one is or redis, including the network between these two containers.

After running the docker-compose file successfully, you can simply run command 'python3 Redis_Chatbot.py' in your terminal.

You will see following instruction:
